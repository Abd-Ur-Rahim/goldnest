## Project Overview
This is our submission for **Devthon 2.0 Web Implementation Round**, developed by the Code Mavericks team. The Gold-Based Micro-Investment Platform is a web application that allows users in Sri Lanka to invest in gold starting from just Rs. 100. Our goal is to make gold investment accessible, secure, and engaging by leveraging modern web technologies. For this competition, we’ve built a fully interactive frontend prototype based on our Figma UI design, simulating core features with plans for backend integration in the future.

**Live Demo**: [Insert Netlify/Vercel URL here after deployment, e.g., https://gold-micro-investment.netlify.app]

## Features Implemented
- **User Login/Signup**: Simulated authentication with hardcoded credentials.
- **Dashboard**: Displays a user’s gold balance (stored locally).
- **Buy Gold**: Interactive feature to simulate purchasing gold, updating the balance in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly UI, tested across screen sizes.

*Note*: Blockchain, AI insights, and payment integrations are simulated for this demo due to the 5-day timeline. Full backend implementation is planned for future development.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Used for structuring the content and layout of the dashboard page.
- **Styling**: 
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Custom styles defined for the `body` font family, supplemented by Tailwind CSS for responsive design and utility classes.
  - Tailwind CSS - Included via CDN (`https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`) for utility-first styling (e.g., `bg-gray-100`, `grid-cols-1`, `shadow-md`).
  - Font Awesome - Included via CDN (`https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.3/css/all.min.css`) for icons (e.g., `fas fa-bell`, `fab fa-facebook`).
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts - Roboto (400 and 700 weights) imported via `<link>` (`https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap`) for typography.
- **JavaScript**: None explicitly included in the code - No custom JS logic; only the Tailwind CDN script is present, which doesn’t add interactivity beyond configuration.
- **Deployment**: Netlify (or Vercel/GitHub Pages, depending on your choice)
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/gold-micro-investment.git
   ```

### Notes
- **Tech Stack**: Updated to match your dashboard page exactly—no JavaScript interactivity is listed since your code doesn’t include it yet. If you add JS for the “Buy Gold” feature (as we discussed), you can tweak this section later to include “JavaScript - For interactivity (e.g., balance updates).”
- **Placeholders**: Replace `[your-username]` with your GitHub username and `[Insert URL here]` with your Netlify/Vercel link after deployment.
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: This is the full content—just paste it into your `README.md` file on GitHub.

Let me know if you want to add interactivity to your dashboard (e.g., making the “Buy Gold” button work) so I can update this further or provide the code! What’s your next step—setting up the repo or coding the login page?
